Comprehensive yet simple, multi-platform graphics design software. Inspired by the likes of closed-source for-profit apps, kisig aims to be a FOSS alternative. With it, it is possible to create slideshows, posters, art, and more.

## Target platforms

- Windows x64
- Linux x64
- Web (through wasm..?)

## Footnote
